## Overview

This script performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a stock dataset, providing valuable insights into its characteristics.

*Key Components*

1. *Data Loading*: Loads the dataset from "stock_data.csv" into a pandas DataFrame.
2. *Data Overview*: Displays dataset information (data types, memory usage) and basic statistics (count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, quartiles).
3. *Missing Value Analysis*: Checks for missing values in each column.
4. *Distribution Analysis*: Visualizes histograms with kernel density estimation (KDE) for numeric columns.
5. *Correlation Analysis*: Creates a heatmap showing correlation between numeric columns.
6. *Outlier Detection*: Uses box plots to identify outliers in numeric columns.
7. *Scatter Plots*: Visualizes relationships between consecutive numeric columns.

*Libraries Used*

1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn

*Example Use Cases*

1. Understanding stock price distributions.
2. Identifying correlations between stock metrics.
3. Detecting outliers in stock data.
4. Visualizing relationships between stock features.

*Advice*

1. Customize the script for specific datasets.
2. Explore additional visualization tools (e.g., violin plots, pair plots).
3. Perform statistical tests for hypothesis validation.
4. Consider dimensionality reduction techniques for high-dimensional data.
